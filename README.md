# admin-api

This was my first real 'project', having mostly done bits of scripting for CTF challenges; written as a proof of concept to pitch to Management/IT at work.  My hope was to refine a few time consuming manual processes in the Ops office (and get a better job...).

A few of the ideas I proposed were put into place and saved some money but unfortunately I was still made redundant before I could see this in production. 

It still needs work - I may pick it back up and build out the front end client in React or something, though, it feels a little too bespoke to continue with given the circumstance.

If nothing else it made me interested in a career in development, so I'm uploading it as the beginnings of a portfolio.  I've left comments in the models.py to try explain the function/intent...enjoy.
